# Levels

## Settings

### Percentage Based
By default, projects and subjects are created with 5 levels that default to "White Belt" at 10%, "Blue Belt" at 25%, 
"Purple Belt" at 45%, "Brown Belt" at 67%, and "Black Belt" at 92%. This allows levels to be fluid as Subjects and Skills
are defined. 


### Point Based
Using Project -> Settings levels can be changed to point-based, where each level requires an explicit number of points
to be achieved. Note that a project must have at least 100 total points defined before this setting can be enabled. Using points-based
levels permits the addition of new project or subject levels without needing to edit the percentage thresholds of previous levels.

### Notes
In the event that a project is switched to points-based levels, any empty subjects (subjects with no skills) will have levels
based on a theoretical points maximum of 1000 e.g., "White Belt" at 100-250 points, "Blue Belt" at 250-450 points, "Purple Belt" at 450-670, etc. These values can 
be easily edited after the configuration change if desired.
