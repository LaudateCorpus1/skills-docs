# Global Badges

Global Badges are a special kind of badge that is made up of a collection of skills and/or levels that span across project boundaries.  When all of the skills and/or levels are accomplished that badge is earned.
Global Badges are specifically used to reward users for achieving skills that involve multiple projects, and can only be created by Dashboard users that have the "Supervisor" role.  

Creating global badges is simple: 
1. Navigate to ``Home -> Badges`` and click ``Badge +``
   - You can (and should) assign an [Icon](/dashboard/user-guide/icons.html) to your badge.
1. Once a badge is created you can assign existing skills and/or project levels to that badge.  
  - To assign skills,  ``Home -> Badge -> Manage -> Skills``
  - To assign project levels,  ``Home -> Badge -> Manage -> Levels``
