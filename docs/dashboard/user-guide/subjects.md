# Subjects

A Project is composed of Subjects which are made of Skills and a single skill defines a training unit within the gamification framework. 
Subjects are a way to group and organize skill definitions and skill training profile. Subjects offer the following features: 

- [Skills](/dashboard/user-guide/skills.html) - create and manage skill definitions.
- [Levels Model](/dashboard/user-guide/levels.html) - subject specific level model definition so users are awarded subject level achievements.
- [Icons](/dashboard/user-guide/icons.html) - assign subject specific icon based on fontawesome or material icon sets or use a custom icon. 
- Stats - Subject specific charts and graph and user stats. 
 
To create a subject navigate to ``Project -> Subjects`` and then click ``Subject +`` button.

| Property | Explanation |

#### Best practices   
- Do your best to create either 3 or 6 subjects. On a larger screen, [Skills Display](/skills-client/#skills-display) renders up-to 3 subjects per row so 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.. will look the best.
- Use the same icon style/set for all subjects. We support font awesome, material and custom [icons](/dashboard/user-guide/icons.html) 
- Strive for each subject to have a similar number of points. The ``Project -> Subjects`` page show subject cards and each card exposes ``Points %`` from the entire points posture.
