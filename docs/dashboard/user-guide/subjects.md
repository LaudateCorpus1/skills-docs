# Subjects

Project is composed of Subjects which are made of Skills and a single skill defines a training unit within the gamification framework. 
Subjects are a way to group and organize skill definitions and skill training profile. Subjects offer the following features: 

- [Skills](/dashboard/user-guide/skills.html) - Create and manage skill definitions
- [Levels Model](/dashboard/user-guide/levels.html) - subject specific level model definition so users are awarded subject level achievements
- [Icons](/dashboard/user-guide/icons.html) - assign subject specific icon based on fontawesome or material icon sets or set a custom icon. 
- Stats - Subject specific charts and graph and user stats. 
 
To create a subject navigate to ``Project -> Subjects`` and then click ``Subject +`` button.  

#### Best practices   
- Do your best to create either 3 or 6 subjects. On a larger screen [Skills Display](/skills-client/#skills-display) renders up-to 3 subjects per row so 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.. will look the best.
- User the same icon style/set for all subjects. We support font awesome, material and custom [icons](/dashboard/user-guide/icons.html) 
- Strive for each subject to have similar number of points. ``Project -> Subjects`` page show subject cards and each card exposes ``Points %`` from the entire points posture.
