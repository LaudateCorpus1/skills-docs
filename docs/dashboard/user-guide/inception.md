# Inception

Inception is a special project within dashboard that gamifies training for the dashboard itself. 
All the dashboard users will have a button on the top right of the application which navigates to your skills profile. 
This button will also display your current level standing.

Inception project by default is owned and managed by any Root Administrator of Dashboard. Of course they have the freedom to add other users.
