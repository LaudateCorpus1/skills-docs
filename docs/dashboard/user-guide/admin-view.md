# Admin View

Admin view provides access to project administrators to create and manage training profiles. 
The page is clearly labeled with an ``Admin`` stamp which differentiates the view from the [Progress and Ranking view](/dashboard/user-guide/progress-and-ranking.html)

To get started with managing a training profile create a [Project](/dashboard/user-guide/projects.html) followed by [Subjects](/dashboard/user-guide/subjects.html) and then [Skills](/dashboard/user-guide/skills.html). 
Please visit [Building Training Profile](/dashboard/user-guide/#building-training-profile) section to learn more. 

::: tip
By default [Progress and Ranking view](/dashboard/user-guide/progress-and-ranking.html) is the landing page but can be changed to the Admin View via [Preferences Page](/dashboard/user-guide/settings.html#preferences)

::: tip NOTE
Please note that in the rare case that a single user creates more than 10 projects, they will be displayed in tabular format instead of the default card display.
