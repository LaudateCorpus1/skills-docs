::: tip
Consider creating skills that won't be reported automatically but rather will require users to contact the application owner who will then 
[Manually add the Skill](/dashboard/user-guide/skills.html#manually-add-skill-event). Why would you do that? If you want to encourage
customer interaction such as collecting success stories. In fact ``Report A Success Story`` can be a skill of its own!
