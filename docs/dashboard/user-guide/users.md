## Skills Display / Client Display

You can see what user's skills profile and progress display would like for a particular user by navigating to a specific user page ``Project -> Users -> Select a User -> Client Display``. 
This is the same exact plugable [Skills Display](/skills-client/#skills-display) that you would be embedding into your application so it can serve as a preview, an ability to look through that user's point of view.  
Client display will depict project skills profile and users points at that exact moment. 

::: tip 
We suggest to often visit [Skills Display](/skills-client/#skills-display) view while building skill profile to better understand how your users will view gamificaiton profile and their progress. 
Optionally can also [Add Events Manually](/dashboard/user-guide/skills.html#skills-versioning) to better understand client's display.  
::: 

If your gamification profile is utilizing [Skills Versioning](/dashboard/user-guide/skills.html#skills-versioning) then you can view 
what the [Skills Display](/skills-client/#skills-display) would look like for a specific version by selecting a different version in the drop-down located on the top-right of the page. 

## Performed Skills

To see a history of user's performed skill events please visit ``Project -> Users -> Select a User -> Performed Skills``. Furthermore you have an ability to remove a single skill event if needed.
