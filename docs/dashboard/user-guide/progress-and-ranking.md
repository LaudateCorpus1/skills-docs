The Progress and Ranking view provides a single point of access for training profiles available to the user as well as a mechanism for Projects that consist entirely of self-reported Skills to provide access to the Skills Display
for their users. Please visit [Self Reporting](/dashboard/user-guide/self-reporting.html) to learn more.  

::: tip
By default, the Progress and Ranking view is the landing page but can be changed to the [Admin View](/dashboard/user-guide/admin-view.html) via [Preferences Page](/dashboard/user-guide/settings.html#preferences)
