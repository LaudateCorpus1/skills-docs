# Progress and Ranking

The Progress and Ranking view gives a user access to the Skills Display for _all_ projects which have Production Mode enabled
on that instance of the SkillTree platform. It provides a single point of access for training profiles available to the
user as well as a mechanism for Projects that consist entirely of self-reported Skills to provide access to the [Ranking and Progress](#ranking-and-progress-display) display
for their users. Each Project Summary information card is clickable and will display the current user's full [Ranking and Progress](#ranking-and-progress-display) display for that project when clicked.

As of version 1.4.0, the default view in the Dashboard has changed. Now, when a user accesses the Dashboard, a Progress and Rankings view
for all projects with ```Production Mode``` enabled will be displayed for the current user. This allows the current user to access their Progress and Ranking for
all projects available on that instance of SkillTree in one place. Both the ```Progress and Ranking``` and the ```Project Admin```
views can be accessed from the drop down menu at the top right.

::: tip
The default view can be configured per user via the [Preferences Page](/dashboard/user-guide/settings.html#preferences)
