# Badges

Badges add another facet to the overall gamification profile and allows you to further reward your users by providing these prestigious symbols. 
Badges are a collection of skills and when all of the skills are accomplished that badge is earned. 

Creating badges is simple: 
1. Navigate to ``Project -> Badges`` and click ``Badge +``
   - You can (and should) assign an [Icon](/dashboard/user-guide/icons.html) to your badge.
1. Once a badge is created you can assign existing skills to that badge under ``Project -> Badge -> Skills``
 
## Gem

Gems are special badges that are only available within a configured time window. 
Users must complete all of the gem's skills within that window in order to earn this precious stone!  

You can enable and configure a gem within the badge edit dialog by selecting ``Enable Gem Feature``.
