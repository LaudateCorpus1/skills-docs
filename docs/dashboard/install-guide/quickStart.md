# Quick Start


Overall steps to getting started with Skills as a Service are:
1. [Prerequisites](/dashboard/install-guide/quickStart.html#prerequisites) - don't worry there isn't much here
1. [Install Dashboard](/dashboard/install-guide/quickStart.html#install-dashboard) and create your project
1. [Integrate User Skills Display](/dashboard/install-guide/quickStart.html#integrate-user-skills-display) into your application.
1. [Report Skill Events](/dashboard/install-guide/quickStart.html#integrate-user-skills-display) using one of our drivers. 

## Prerequisites

Dashboard requires Java Runtime Environment 11 +, we suggest using [OpenJDK packages](https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html). Please note that this is not relevant if you elect to go with the Docker based install.

## Install Dashboard

You can utilize a pre-built docker image to run a production grade Skills Dashboard or you can download the latest distribution.
