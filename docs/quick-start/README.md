# Quick Start


Overall steps to getting started with Skills as a Service are:
1. [Prerequisites](/quick-start/#prerequisites) - don't worry there isn't much here
1. [Install Dashboard](/quick-start/#install-dashboard) and create your project
1. [Integrate User Skills Display](/quick-start/#integrate-user-skills-display) into your application.
1. [Report Skill Events](/quick-start/#integrate-user-skills-display) using one of our drivers. 

## Prerequisites

Dashboard requires Java Runtime Environment 11 +, we suggest using [OpenJDK packages](https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html). Please note that this is not relevant if you elect to go with the Docker based install.
